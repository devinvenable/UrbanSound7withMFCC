Unfortunately sharing Notebooks that require large datasets is not so easy on Github. 
To train you'll need to find and download the Urban Sound dataset.  Luckily it appears to still be available here:

Due to this limitation, I've removed most of the notebook code so that some small subset can be run with incomplete data, 
which I've included here.
